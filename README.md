# Bank account management system
A proper bank management system is required to keep the money and critical information such as transaction details safe. In this project we have implemented = two derived classes namely credit account and savings account.
The savings account is one wherein a person can deposit his money and later withdraw the same. 
The credit account is one in which a person may/ or may not have sufficient money to perform a transaction and can still withdraw money but later should pay back the bank with some interest amount.
